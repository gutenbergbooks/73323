<h3 class="nobreak">ORIGIN AND CHIEF HISTORICAL EVENTS</h3>
</div>

<p>Soissons derives its name from the <i>Suessiones</i>, a Belgian tribe who
inhabited that part of the country during the Gallic period. At that
time the City, then known as <i>Noviodunum</i>, was situated about two
and a half miles north-west of the Aisne on the Pommiers Plateau.
After Cæsar’s conquest of the country, the city was rebuilt on the
banks of the Aisne, under the name of <i>Augusta Suessionum</i>. Of the
Gallo-Roman epoch, only a small portion of the city ramparts (<i>p. </i><a href="#Page_32">32</a>)
remains, but excavations have brought to light the site of a large
theatre (<i>p. </i><a href="#Page_51">51)</a>, and at the Mail, the foundations of what were luxurious
villas. The greater part of the objects unearthed are in the
Museum (<i>p. </i><a href="#Page_41">41</a>), with the exception of the famous group «Le Niobide
et son Pédagogue», now in the Louvre.</p>

<p>Christianity was first preached in Soissons at the end of the 3rd
century, by two shoemakers, the brothers Crispin and Crispinian,
who suffered martyrdom there.</p>

<p>Soissons played an important part throughout the whole of the
Frankish Monarchy. It was at its gates that in 486, Clovis won a
decisive victory over the last Roman Count, <i>Syagrius</i>, thus causing
the downfall of Roman domination in Gaul. It was after this victory
that the famous episode of the Soissons Vase occurred.</p>

<p>The Frankish King lived for a long time in the city, and at his death
in 511, Soissons became the capital of the kingdom of one of his sons,
<i>Clotaire I</i>, who ultimately became sole king of the Franks. Later,
Soissons once more became a separate kingdom under <i>Chilperic</i>,
and again under <i>Clotaire II</i> (561–613). During this period, the rivalry
of <i>Brunehaut</i> and <i>Frédégonde</i> gave rise to sanguinary episodes
in Soissons and the surrounding country.</p>

<p>In the 8th century, Soissons witnessed the fall of the Merovingian
dynasty. In 752, <i>Pépin-le-Bref</i> was proclaimed King by an assembly
of nobles in the monastery of Saint-Médard (<i>p. </i><a href="#Page_61">61</a>).</p>

<p>In the same abbey, in 833, the emperor <i>Louis-le-Débonnaire</i>, was
deposed and imprisoned by his rebel sons, after they had forced him
to make a public confession in the church of the monastery.</p>

<p>In 923, under the walls of Soissons, <i>Charles-le-Simple</i> fought a
battle with his rival <i>Robert</i>, Duke of the Franks. In this battle,
Charles was taken prisoner and lost his throne, which passed to the
powerful House of France, whence sprang the Capetian dynasty.</p>

<p>Throughout the Middle-Ages, religious life was intensely active
at Soissons. At that time, the City comprised six large monasteries, in
addition to the Cathedral and several churches or collegiates. It
was none the less a lay fief with the rank of county, which in 1131
obtained a communal charter under <i>Louis-le-Gros</i>, and on the accession
of <i>Francis I</i>, became definitely part of the crown lands.</p>

<p>Situated on the main roads of invasion, Soissons has always been
one of the advance posts which protect Paris. For this reason, it
has suffered numerous sieges, most of them disastrous, owing to the
unfavourable situation of the city, which lies in a plain surrounded
by hills. It was taken and pillaged in 1414 by the troops of <i>Charles
VI</i>, in 1544 by <i>Charles-Quint</i>, and in 1567 by the Protestants. In
1814, during the French campaign, it was conquered by the Russians
and Prussians, whilst in 1815, after Waterloo, it had to re-open its
gates to the Allies.</p>

<p>In 1870, a German Army of 20,000 men laid siege to Soissons on
September 11. The garrison of 5,000 soldiers which held the town
refused to surrender,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>

and attempted several unsuccessful sorties.
Posted on the surrounding heights, the German artillery violently
bombarded the town, setting fire to some of the suburbs, the hospital,
and part of the military commissariat established in the old Abbey
of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes. A breach was finally made in the fortifications,
and on October 16, after a siege of thirty-seven days, the city
was forced to surrender.</p>

<p>During the late war, Soissons was twice occupied by the Germans:
in 1914, from September 2 to 13, and in 1918, from May 29 to August
2, after the surprise attack at the Chemin-des-Dames (<i>See pp. </i><a href="#Page_4">4</a><i> &amp; </i><a href="#Page_7">7)</a>.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY</h3>

<p>Soissons, sub-prefecture of the Aisne, was formerly fortified, but
was dismantled after the Franco-German war of 1870. Before the
late War, its population numbered 14 458.</p>

<p>The city proper remained confined within the narrow limits of its
ancient walls. It is bounded on the east by the River Aisne, on the
south by the small stream <i>Crise</i>, on the west by the Boulevard Jeanne
d’Arc which follows the line of the old ramparts, and on the north by
the rue Saint-Léger, near which may be seen (close to the tennis court)
part of the remains of the old fortifications (<i>See plan, p. </i><a href="#Page_12">12</a>).</p>

<p>Beyond, lie the <i>faubourgs</i>: to the west and south, the modern faubourgs
of Saint-Christophe, Crise, and Rheims; to the east, on the
right bank of the Aisne, the old faubourgs: Saint-Waast (named
after the Bishop who converted Clovis to Christianity), and Saint-Médard
(after the Bishop who was buried there during the Merovingian
epoch).</p>

<p>Before the War, Soissons was an important provision centre for
Paris (corn and haricot beans). In its suburbs were numerous industrial
concerns: boiler manufactories, mechanical workshops and various
factories, distilleries, sugar-refineries, etc...</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE GERMAN OCCUPATION IN 1914</h3>

<p>After the battle of Charleroi, despite the vigorous and determined
counter-offensive launched from Guise to Saint-Quentin on August 29–30,
the Franco-British Armies continued their retreat southwards.</p>

<p>During the evening of August 31, the Valabrègue group of reserve
divisions holding the Vauxaillon-Laffaux-Vaudesson sector, and
acting as flank-guard to the French 5th Army, remained as a covering
force to the north-east of Soissons. It was not, however, intended
to defend the town, and the only object in resisting the enemy at this
point was to cover the French retirement and ensure the safe passage
of the Aisne. Soissons thus became momentarily of primary importance.
Large detachments of enemy cavalry wedged themselves
between the British and French Armies, and advancing from Noyon
towards Soissons, became a formidable menace to the French retirement
across the Aisne.</p>

<p>During the night of August 31, a cavalry division was ordered to
proceed with all despatch from Craonne to Soissons. Next morning
a portion of this division took up a position north of the town, in the
neighbourhood of Cuffies, with orders to hold it so long as the reserve
divisions east of the town had not crossed the Aisne. The remainder
halted on the Belleu Hills, with a view to guarding the river on either
side of the town. At about 10 a.m., the enemy came within sight
of Soissons and was brought to a standstill for two hours by French
cavalry and cyclist scouts. Early in the afternoon, the rear-guard
of the holding force being informed that the French army had succeeded
in crossing the Aisne, retired in an orderly manner towards
Septmonts and Buzancy.</p>

<p>On September 2, the Germans occupied the town, but though they
levied heavy requisitions, did not commit any act of pillage or vandalism.</p>

<br>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE GERMAN EVACUATION</h3>

<p>After the victory of the Marne, the French 6th Army on the Ourcq,
keeping touch with the British on the right, advanced towards the
Aisne. On September 11, the townspeople showed signs of uneasiness.
The 45th Division, which formed the right wing of General Maunoury’s
Army, was marching up the Ourcq and Savière valleys
against Soissons, having crushed the enemy’s attempted resistance
at Chaudun.</p>

<p>On the following day, African troops, assisted by the fire of British
artillery stationed at Buzancy, entered the town. As the bridges
had been blown up by the retreating enemy, the night had to be spent
in the construction of foot-bridges, the work being carried out under
fire from the German heavy artillery.</p>

<p>On September 13, the Zouaves and Tirailleurs, under the command
of General Quiquandon, attacked Hill 132, which dominates Soissons
on the immediate north, but were unable to eject the strong enemy
detachments there. Repeated attacks on September 14, 17, 23 and
30 were not more fortunate. The Germans could not be dislodged
from these hills which, on account of their many deep quarries and
horizontal shafts, formed natural fortresses, and gave them a vantage
ground for the indiscriminate bombardment of Soissons.</p>

<p><i>These bombardments will be dealt with further on. They aimed almost
exclusively at the destruction of the town, and as they served no military
purpose, they need not be included in this account of the military operations.</i></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">FRENCH EFFORTS TO FREE SOISSONS</h3>

<p>The destructive bombardment of the town continuing, the French
High Command decided, at the beginning of January 1915, to make
another attempt to free Soissons.</p>

<p>On January 8, a battalion of Chasseurs and one of Moroccan Sharp-shooters,
supported by men of the 55th Division, attacked and
succeeded in gaining the top of the north-east hill, thus obtaining
a footing on Spur 132 (<i>see map., p. </i><a href="#Page_53">53</a>).</p>

<p>On the 12th, the Germans attacked violently in front of Crouy
and Hill 132, at a time when the Aisne floods had carried away the foot-bridges,
and threatened to cut the French communications, which
at the time depended solely on the Saint-Waast bridge.</p>

<p>After a fierce struggle which lasted till nightfall, the French lost
the line, along the hills north of the town. A division of the 7th
Corps was thrown into the battle, and by a brilliant attack recaptured
part of ridge 132. However, as the communications with the left
bank of the Aisne were becoming more and more precarious, it received
orders to cover the general retreat decreed by General Maunoury.
On the night of the 13th, the French retired across the Aisne
leaving only one strongly fortified bridge-head between the distillery
and Saint-Paul on the northern bank (<i>see pp. </i><a href="#Page_56">56</a><i> &amp; </i><a href="#Page_61">61</a>).</p>

<p>From the 14th onwards, the Germans commenced attacking the
bridge-head in massed formation. They succeeded for a moment
in getting into the little hamlet of Saint-Paul, about a mile from the
first houses of Soissons, but they were driven out on the same day.
On the 16th, enemy bombardment compelled a fresh party of the
townspeople to leave their homes. After further fruitless endeavours
the Germans abandoned their attacks, and the relative calm of trench
warfare set in again in this sector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">LIBERATION OF SOISSONS IN 1917</h3>

<p>Until March 1917, the opposing lines underwent no further important
modifications. Here and there, however, their defences had been
considerably strengthened by redoubts, concrete machine-gun emplacements
and very formidable barbed-wire entanglements.</p>

<p><i>The second itinerary</i> (<i>pp. </i><a href="#Page_52">52–64</a>) will enable those interested to inspect
parts of these lines, which form a rough semi-circle around Soissons and
are quite close to the city.</p>

<p>The German retirement in March 1917 along both banks of the Oise,
covered only a very small extent of ground in the neighbourhood of
Soissons, which formed the pivot of the manœuvre.</p>

<p>The new front was less than five miles behind the old one and, though
the town remained within easy range of the German heavy artillery,
bombardment was less frequent than before.</p>

<p>From March 17, the Germans abandoned their trenches at Crouy
and on Hill 132, but tried to stem the French forward push. They
launched violent counter-attacks between Vregny and Margival, and
the French advanced only step by step to the first trenches of the
redoubtable Hindenburg line. By the end of the month, they had
scarcely advanced beyond Neuville-sur-Margival and Leuilly. On
April 1, they attacked along the line of the Ailette-Laon road, and
reached the outskirts of Laffaux and Vauxaillon. The French occupied
this last village and Vauxeny during the following days, but their
advance went no further.</p>

<p>On April 16, the 6th Army under General Mangin attacked in conjunction
with the 5th Army on the east. This offensive was only
partly successful. To the north-east of Soissons, where the first Colonial
Corps was in action, the French made but little progress, and
failed to take the Moisy Farm Plateau. Laffaux was alternately taken
and lost, and was only definitely occupied on the 19th. At dawn on
May 5, a new offensive was started along the whole front south-east
of Vauxaillon. Moisy Farm and Laffaux Mill were taken by the
French Colonials and Cuirassiers on foot, and held despite numerous
fierce counter-attacks. The next day, they advanced yet further
north of the mill. The Germans, who could not resign themselves
to the loss of these key positions, made repeated endeavours to
retake them, and the Soissons sector became “a new Verdun.” On
October 23, 1917, General Maistre ordered a vigorous offensive, and
while the 38th division (General de Salins) captured the Malmaison
fort, the 21st Corps (General Degoutte) captured with a single rush
the villages of Allemant and Vaudesson. On the 25th, the French
occupied the village and forest of Pinon and reached the line of
the canal between the Oise and the Aisne. Soissons was now quite
cleared.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE GERMAN OCCUPATION IN 1918</h3>

<p>In 1918, Soissons had again to face the horrors of invasion. On
May 27 1918, after the failure of the two German offensives against
Paris and Amiens, the Crown Prince threw his divisions forward in
a formidable attack along the Aisne Front. The Germans, taking full
advantage of the surprise which gave them an absolute numerical
superiority, crossed the Chemin-des-Dames in the early hours of the
morning. Then, while east of Soissons they were crossing the Aisne
in the direction of Vailly and advancing along the left bank of the
river as far as the Vesle, they made progress to the north-east in
the direction of the undulating plains which sheltered the town.</p>

<p>On the 28th, despite the bitter resistance of the few French units
in this sector, they succeeded in getting a footing in the plains of
Vregny and Crouy, and crept along the southern bank of the Aisne
to the very gates of Soissons, the east and south-east suburbs of which
this converging movement enabled them to attain.</p>

<p>The next day, May 29, they captured the suburbs of Saint-Waast and
Saint-Médard on the right bank. Then a party of Brandeburg sappers,
advancing in front of the attacking force, captured the bridges, and
prevented the French from destroying them. About noon, the Germans
entered the town, and after street-fighting which lasted several
hours, drove back the French into the western suburbs. The French
however, still held Pasly Hill to the north-east of Soissons. Throughout
the night, French artillery bombarded the approaches of the town and
all the places where the Aisne could be crossed, while enfilading fire from

<span class="pagenum">[Pg 8]</span>

the machine-guns prevented the German soldiers from using the streets.
Not until nine o’clock on the morning of the 30th did the enemy capture
Pasly Hill and thus secure entire possession of Soissons.</p>

<p>For two days the French clung desperately to the western approaches
of the town, but to the south, the Germans established
themselves in the angle formed by the Aisne and the Crise, and succeeded
in capturing Vierzy and Chaudun. The French positions
were thus taken in the rear, and had to be abandoned, step by step,
after stubborn fighting.</p>

<p>The arrival of reinforcements at the beginning of June, enabled
the French definitely to check the enemy, who by this time was exhausted.
Though the Germans launched many violent attacks west
of Soissons, they were unable to advance beyond the Amblény-Longpont
line, six or seven miles from the town, which left the Allies
free possession of the Paris road through Villers-Cotterets Wood.</p>

</div>
</div>
<br>

<p>During the second period of occupation, which lasted from May
29 till August 2, the Germans systematically pillaged the city.
Every house was emptied of its contents. Before being despatched to
Germany, the plunder was centralized in certain places indicated
by signs bearing the words “Zur Beutesammelstelle” (to the
booty-collecting-centre), with an arrow (<i>photo opposite</i>).</p>

<p>Objects which, by reason of their weight or bulk, could not be
transported, were destroyed or spoilt.</p>

<p>From July 18 onwards, General Mangin successfully attacked the
right flank of the German Army, with the result that on August 2,
Soissons was once more in French hands. At 6 p.m. on that day,
French Chasseurs under General Vuillemot crossed the burning
town and reached the Aisne bridges, beyond which, in the Saint-Waast
suburb, the enemy rear-guard made a last stand (<i>photo p. </i><a href="#Page_9">9</a>).
One of the pivots of the wedge driven between the Marne and the
Aisne by the German Armies, had given way, and the enemy was
soon forced to retire as far as the Vesle.</p>

<p>The offensive was stayed for a moment in front of the strong hill
positions on the north bank of the Aisne, where the Germans had
entrenched themselves. An intense bombardment then completed
the city’s ruin. The French advance began again at the end of
August. On the 30th and 31st, Cuffies and Crouy were retaken
while on the following days the battle continued furiously on the
heights north and east of Soissons. General Mangin’s Army succeeded
in advancing as far as the plains of Vauxaillon, Laffaux and Vregny,
whence it soon dislodged the enemy.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">THE BOMBARDMENTS OF SOISSONS</h3>

<p>As soon as they were driven out of Soissons in September 1914,
the enemy proceeded to bombard the city. During the latter part of
September, the cannonade was incessant, the fire being directed
successively on all the different quarters and public buildings,
including the hospital filled with wounded.</p>
<br>
<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">MASS IN THE CATHEDRAL 1917.</div>
</div>
<br>

<p>After a short lull, the bombardment continued with great violence
throughout January 1915.</p>

<p>On January 8, the Palais-de-Justice was set on fire, and on the 9th,
the Cathedral was struck by 42 shells. On January 14, the shelling
lasted all day, and until the end of February, the firing continued
with the same intensity and almost without pause. The Cathedral was
systematically aimed at, as is proved by the note book belonging to the
Kommandant of the “Ringkanonenbatterie” posted north-east of Soissons
on Hill 132, which fell into the Allies’ hands.</p>
<br>
<div class="figcenter">

<br>

<p>On January 31, he wrote: “The battery fired nineteen rounds of
percussion and fuze shells at the Cathedral. The tower and nave were
hit several times, and the beginning of a fire was noticed in the
nave. So far, we have not been able to do much damage to the tower
...” On February 2, a battery fired twenty-nine rounds of shrapnel at
the Cathedral, and in particular at the tower, sixteen of which hit
the mark. On February 25, twenty-one shells were fired at the same
target. As for the town itself, another 200 rounds were fired into it
on February 28. The bombardment slackened later, but began again at
intervals, without any apparent reason and with varying intensity.
It was continued until the middle of March 1917, when the German
withdrawal from the Somme to the Aisne freed Soissons, which could now
only be reached by the long-range guns. However aeroplanes frequently
dropped incendiary bombs on the city.</p>

<br>

<h3 class="nobreak">A thirty-months’ Siege.</h3>

<p>From September 1914 to March 1917, while the Germans remained
at the gates of the city, the latter was veritably besieged. Notwithstanding
the increasing destruction caused by the shells, the civil population
continued bravely to “carry on”. Part of the population
refused to leave the city, while here and there, on the walls that were
left standing, printed notices announced the fact that the house was
still occupied. Then followed the names of the courageous inmates.
During the bombardments, the people took shelter in the cellars, only
to resume their ordinary daily occupations as soon as the firing ceased.
The public services continued to work normally. Many shops were
kept open, and an hotel was available for the travellers who arrived
by the night omnibus that linked up the city with Vierzy, the nearest
point on the railway.</p>

<p>In parts of the city, it was only possible to get about by making use
of the communication trenches which ran along the side of the roads.
One such trench ran the whole length of the Boulevard Jeanne-d’Arc
(<i>photo above</i>), while others crossed the Town-Hall gardens (<i>See p. </i><a href="#Page_40">40</a>)
and the streets near the Aisne.</p>

<p>Moreover, getting about was restricted to certain quarters of the
city as, just beyond the centre, the defensive works (barricades, trenches,
etc.) began.</p>

<p><i>These works are described in the second Itinerary (p. <a href="#Page_52">52–64</a>)
which takes the tourist from the centre of the town to the first line

<p>The Cathedral of Soissons (H.M.) may be considered as a miniature of
that of Amiens. For the purity of its lines and simplicity of arrangement,
it is probably the finest of the secondary Cathedrals in France.</p>
<br>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_16.jpg" alt="Photograph of the Cathedral before the War." width="600" height="926">
<div class="caption">THE CATHEDRAL BEFORE THE WAR.<br>
<i>The unfinished main front had only one tower.</i></div>
</div>
<br>

<p>It was very quickly built, of hard Soissons stone, and is peculiar
in that building began at the south arm of the transept,—primitive
Gothic in style,—during the last third of the 12th century. Next were
built, in pointed Gothic, the choir (completed in 1212) then the
nave. The main body of the cathedral was completed in the middle
of the 13th century, with the exception of the high parts of the main
front (on which a single tower was built in the 14th century) and of
the façade of the north arm of the transept (also 14th century).</p>

<p>The cathedral of Soissons, like that of Arras, has greatly suffered
in its vital parts. The nave, which partly fell in during 1915–1916,
was, with the aisles, entirely destroyed by the end of 1918. The tower,
which, though severely damaged by enemy shell-fire, was still standing,
collapsed at the same time. The transept and choir alone escaped
with slight damage.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">Principal Façade of the Cathedral.</h4>

<p>The West front contains three doorways, finished about 1230,
but disfigured in the 18th century by roughcast, which destroyed their
13th century decoration, since replaced by pseudo-Gothic ornament.</p>

<i>The collapse of the mullion laid bare the framework of the belfry.</i>
</div>
</div>
<br>

<p>Above the large rose-window, set in a tierce-point arch, rises a
graceful gallery composed of double arches surmounted by gables,
which is carried all round the single tower, about 241 feet in height.</p>

<p>The tower comprised on each front two long bays separated by a
mullion. Its later date was noticeable chiefly in the statues of apostles,
saints and bishops, sheltered beneath finely carved canopies, which
ornamented the corner abutments.</p>

<p>Throughout the war, the German gunners made a constant target
of the cathedral tower.</p>

<p>In June 1915, large calibre shells caused the collapse of the great
mullion separating the two bays on the west front, which fell to the
ground, a large breach in the upper part of the tower laying bare the
framework of the belfry (<i>photo above</i>). The same collapse caused
the fall of almost all the gables of the lower gallery, the left bay of
which had previously been struck by several shells.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>Until 1918, no further damage of importance was done to the façade,
but in August of that year, some days after the French had retaken
Soissons, three sides of the tower (north, south and east) and the
interior framework of the belfry were entirely destroyed by the
numerous German shells.</p>

<p>In September 1918, all that remained of the tower were the two
buttresses at the north-west and south-west corners. By a miracle they
remain poised, but loosened stones keep constantly crashing to the
ground (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p>All the arches of the gallery above the large rose-window were also
destroyed in August 1918.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">Interior of the Cathedral.</h4>

<p>The cathedral, over 300 feet in length, comprises:</p>

<p class="p2">A Nave with seven bays and double side-aisles, with chapels of a
later date added to the last four bays.</p>
<p class="p2">A Transept, the south arm of which ends in a semi-circle, and the

ambulatory, off which open eight rectangular chapels, and, at the
apse, five radial polygonal chapels.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">The Nave before the Bombardments.</h4>

<p>Completed about 1230, the Nave—now entirely destroyed—was
regarded before the war as one of the best examples of the harmonious
simplicity of early 13th century Gothic architecture.</p>

<p>The central vault was about 103 feet in height.</p>

<p>The bays were divided by columns flanked on the side facing the
grand nave by a small engaged shaft. On their fine capitals, decorated
with four rows of crockets or foliage, rested the large arches of
the ground floor, and the groups of five small columns which supported
the springing of the pointed arches of the vault.</p>

<p>The large arcades were surmounted by a shallow triforium and
high double windows with dividing mullions.</p>

<p>The wide, lofty aisles with windows gave additional light to the
body of the church. Their vaulting was pointed and terminated at
the last bays in chapels built for the most part in the 18th century.</p>

<p>In the second bay of the north aisle, a gallery (<i>B on plan</i>), the
remains of the old cathedral cloister, gave access to a large chapel
(Chapelle des Œuvres) with two naves of three bays. It was the old
chapter-house, built in the 13th century, by prolonging the west front
but completely remodelled in the 19th century.</p>

in two about 13 feet from the ground (<i>photos pp. </i><a href="#Page_20">20–21</a>). The upper
part, with the capital and courses supporting the springing of the
vault, gave way, dragging down in its fall a portion of the vault and of
the wall at the back of the triforium.</p>

<p>The ruins accumulated rapidly. By the end of March, the roof
of the grand nave and of the north aisle, which the broken pillar had
sustained, collapsed. The whole of the triforium, the large window,
the flying buttress outside, the framework, and the roofing of the bay
of the aisle also gave way. An enormous breach was made in the
cathedral, and the floor of the nave was covered with a shapeless mass
of broken stones, which increased during the following months.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">The fall of the Vaulting.</h4>

<p>The vaults of the remaining bays, already weakened, could not
withstand the renewed bombardments. One after another they
crashed to the ground, with the exception of those of the first and
seventh bays. Everywhere else, pieces of broken or disjointed
framework, supporting a completely ruined roof, are exposed to
view (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p>Several of the large windows on the north side have also fallen in
and all the stained-glass has been smashed.</p>

</div>
<br>

<p>The bombardments of 1918 destroyed the nave beyond hope of
repair.</p>

<p>Several large pillars collapsed and a considerable portion of the
upper part of the side walls, large arches and triforium fell in to
the right and left.</p>

<p>Three bays near the west front, with their large arches and the
aisles were completely destroyed. All this masonry fell inside the
nave, forming across its entire breadth a heap of debris more than 19
feet high and about 33 feet long.</p>

<p>Fragments of vaulting, bases of pillars, stones from the roof,
were mixed in shapeless chaos with a quantity of architectural and
sculptured motives, notably the beautiful capitals and the key-stones
of the vault, mostly broken. And on this heap of ruins the roof-timbers
of the framework, deprived of all support, fell by degrees in their
turn.</p>

<p>The old harmonious construction of the nave is now to be seen only
in the bays nearest the transept.</p>

<p>The Chapelle des Œuvres was struck several times. The most serious
damage was caused during the first bombardments of 1914 by a shell
which exploded on the roof of the gallery (<i>B on plan p. </i><a href="#Page_18">18</a>, <i>photo
below</i>) which leads to the chapel. Penetrating the roof and the
framework, it caused the vault to fall in, broke the arches, and
shattered the stained-glass of the chapel windows.</p>

<i>See the exterior, p. </i><a href="#Page_29">29.</a>
</div>
</div>
<br>

<h4 class="nobreak">South Arm of the Transept.</h4>

<p>The bombardments have spared the south arm of the transept,
a marvel of grace and simplicity, built about 1175, by Bishop Nivelon
of Chérisy. It is the oldest and also the least elevated portion of
the cathedral.</p>

<p>The arm of the transept ends in a semi-circle (a peculiarity which
it shares with those of the old Cathedral of Noyon and numerous
Rhenish churches) and is surrounded by an ambulatory.</p>

<p>In style it differs distinctly from that of the rest of the building,
and presents the distinguishing features of primitive Gothic.</p>

<p>The triforium—which elsewhere consists only of a narrow gallery—is
here double. It comprises a story of high, wide, arched tribunes,
grouped three and three, surmounted by a narrow passage with graceful
colonnettes.</p>

<p>The main vault is supported by six pointed ribs which intersect
in a central key-stone ornamented with six angels.</p>

<p>The south arm of the transept is lighted by three series of windows.
Small semi-circular bays are cut in the wall of the ambulatory. The
galleries are lighted—except on the right, which is ornamented with
rose-windows—by tierce-point windows in groups of three. There
is a final row of high tierce-point windows, also in groups of three, above
the triforium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Some of the capitals are masterpieces of ornamental sculpture.
Their decoration consists either of the foliage characteristic of Romanesque
capitals (acanthus leaves) or of projecting crockets,—one
of the earliest examples of this distinctive ornament of Gothic capitals.</p>

<p>On the east side of the south arm of the transept there is a two-storied
polygonal chapel (<i>C on plan, p. </i><a href="#Page_18">18</a>) of the same period. The
key-stone of the vault of the lower chapel represents two angels carrying
the <i>Agnus Dei</i> on a cloth. The upper chapel, in which the Treasure
was formerly kept, communicates with the galleries.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">The Choir and Apse.</h4>

<p>The choir, where, on the completion of the south arm of the transept,
Bishop Nivelon of Chérisy continued the building of the Cathedral
(1200–1212), is one of the earliest examples of Pointed Gothic—so-called
on account of the sharp outline of the arches. A notable characteristic
of this is the transformation of the wide galleries of the
triforium into a narrow gallery, which gives greater importance to
the wide arches of the ground floor and to the high windows of the
upper story.</p>

<p>Its general plan is similar to that of the nave, built immediately
afterwards: lofty wide arches, narrow triforium, high windows (but
without mullions, forming a single bay), and pointed vaults of rectangular
plan.</p>

<p>The Choir is flanked by side-aisles, off which open, on each side
four rectangular chapels with groined vaults.</p>

<p>The second chapel of the aisle has an inscription recording the
date on which the Canons took possession of the Choir:</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Anno milleno biscenteno duodeno hunc intrare chorum</i><br>
<i>Cepit grex canonicorum tercio idus maii.</i></p>

<p class="p2">(In the year 1212, on the third Ides of May, the Canons first took<br>
possession of the Choir).</p>
<br>
<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_b_26.jpg" alt="Photograph of the Choir." width="600" height="431">
<div class="caption">THE CHOIR.<br>
<i>On the left and at the back sand-bags protected the art treasures.</i>
</div>
</div>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>The south side-aisle communicates with the chapel attached to the
south arm of the transept by a 15th century vaulted corridor (<i>D on
plan p. </i><a href="#Page_18">18</a>) in which there is a fine 16th century statue of the Virgin
and Infant seated.</p>

<p>The two side-aisles continue round the semi-circular apse, forming
an ambulatory surrounded by five shallow radial chapels. The
central chapel is consecrated, as usual, to the Virgin. The pointed
vaults of the chapels unite with those of the ambulatory, eight pointed
ribs meeting in the same key-stone.</p>

<p>The choir, scarcely touched by enemy fire up to December 1916,
suffered more serious damage then and in January 1917.</p>

<p>Shells pierced the vault in two places and also penetrated several
parts of the triforium wall, breaking the arches. In the apse, portions
of the vault were injured and parts of the 13th century stained-glass,
which it was not possible to remove from the high windows, were
damaged.</p>

<p>The vital parts of the choir escaped serious damage, and it was
possible during the second half of 1917, to carry out temporary repairs
after the retreat of the Germans. At the same time, in order to make
the choir—as well as the transept, which had also escaped serious
injury—once more available for public worship, a partition was
built shutting off the nave (<i>photo p. </i><a href="#Page_24">24</a>).</p>

<p>This protective partition shielded part of the building very effectively
in 1918, when the Choir and Transept escaped serious damage.</p>

<p>Most of the fine 13th century stained-glass windows were removed
in 1915 to a place of safety.</p>

<p>They were originally taken from the church of Saint-Yved-de-Braines
and inserted during the 19th century in the high windows of
the apse and those of the Lady Chapel.</p>

<p>Thanks to the protective measures taken, the interior decoration
of the choir escaped injury. It dates from the 18th century and
comprises a high altar of marble, surrounded by a wrought-iron railing,
and flanked by two marble statues of the Virgin and the Angel Gabriel,
depicting the Annunciation. Two consoles of carved and gilded
wood with marble tops, complete this group. The stalls only are 17th
century.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">The North Arm of the Transept.</h4>


<p>The north arm of the transept, flanked by aisles, shows the same
arrangement as the nave, but ends in a straight wall (late 13th century)
which was ornamented in the 14th century. A clerestory gallery
joining the triforium of the side walls, and carried on small, light
columns, is built against this wall. Above are pierced a row of bays
and a fine rose-window containing old stained-glass.</p>

<p>During the war, a fine picture by Rubens (1635), painted for the
Franciscan Fathers in return for their having nursed him through
an illness contracted at Soissons, was removed from the north arm of
the transept to a place of safety. This picture, which represents the
Adoration of the Shepherds, has a fine frame of carved and gilded
wood of the Regency period.</p>

<p>The bombardments did little damage to the north arm of the transept
and to the intersection of the transepts. The worst injury was
the falling in of one of the vaults of the north arm, and the breaking
of the arch-band uniting two of the large pillars of the transept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<h4 class="nobreak">The art treasures.</h4>


<p>In addition to the works of art preserved in the choir and transept,
the Cathedral possesses a fragment of a 16th century <i>tapestry</i>,
all that remains of a large piece devoted to the legend of
Saint-Gervais and Saint-Protais, which, before the War, hung in the
north aisle of the nave.</p>

<br>

<p>Before the War, at the entrance to the nave on each side of the main
portal, were memorial <b>statues</b> of two abbesses of the ancient
abbey of Notre-Dame, represented kneeling, with folded hands, in the
costume of the period: <i>Henriette de Lorraine d’Elbeuf</i>, abbess
from 1660 to 1669, and <i>Gabrielle-Marie de la Rochefoucauld</i>
(1683–1693).</p>

<p><i>Photographs of these two statues are given below.</i></p>

<p>In the sacristy are preserved fragments of flamboyant style
<b>woodwork</b>, a 17th century <b>chalice</b> of finely chased
gilt silver, a magnificent <b>Crucifix</b> by <i>Girardon</i> and a
fine <b>reliquary</b> in gilt copper (1560), representing the plan

<h4 class="nobreak">Side façades of the Cathedral.</h4>


<p>The exterior of Soissons Cathedral is remarkable for the great simplicity
of its lines and its well-balanced construction.</p>

<p>The high vaults are supported by two super-imposed 13th century
flying-buttresses, which are supported on one side by powerful abutments
and on the other by small engaged columns, the capitals of
which are decorated with crockets. (<i>See photos, pp. </i><a href="#Page_20">20</a>, <a href="#Page_22">22</a>, <a href="#Page_24">24</a>).</p>

<p>Against the straight wall which ends the north arm of the
transept are 14th century radiating arcades (<i>p. </i><a
href="#Page_30">30</a>). This wall is pierced by a large rose-window
set in tierce-point arch. It ends in a gable with 14th century
ornament, and is flanked by two bell-turrets, one of which was
destroyed. (<i>Photos, pp. </i><a href="#Page_30">30</a> &amp; <a
href="#Page_31">31</a>).</p>

<p>To the east of the north arm of the transept, obstructing the first
window of the choir aisle, is a 14th century portal with a sharply
pointed gable, supported by two buttresses (<i>photo opposite</i>).
The higher finish and greater adornment of 14th century decorative art
is clearly to be seen here: sharply pointed gables ornamented with
trefoil over the portal and buttresses, and intricately carved bouquets
of foliage on the capitals, replacing the hooked crockets of the
preceding century.</p>

<p>The bombardments seriously damaged the side façades of the
cathedral. All the stone-work, bays, flying-buttresses and abutments,
and all the roofing and framework collapsed as far as the first bays
of the nave. The building is, so to speak, cut into two unequal parts
throughout its entire width, by an immense gap. 
(<i>Photo p. </i><a href="#Page_31">31</a>, <i>Panorama p. </i><a href="#Page_14">14</a>).</p>

<p>The rounded arm of the transept and the south end of the choir
suffered comparatively little. On the other hand, the bombardments
seriously injured the chevet and the north front of the choir. The
upper part of one of the high windows in the apse was struck. A
buttress of the Lady Chapel was badly broken, while two unexploded
shells are embedded in the damaged stone-work of a neighbouring
buttress. On the north front of the choir most of the abutments were
damaged and the flying-buttresses which support it, more or less
injured.</p>

<p>The roofing was ruined and the framework broken. The
north arm of the transept, especially the gable, was also somewhat

<p>However, the north front of the nave suffered most (<i>photo above</i>).
In addition to the opening made at the west end, the stone-work and
roofing were injured throughout their entire length. Only the last
two windows next the transept retained their mullions, the others
being more or less completely destroyed. Of the flying-buttresses
and abutment-piers, very little remains standing.</p>

<p>This church was formerly part of an abbey founded in 1152 in memory

the Palace, Ebroïn.</p>

<p>The nave and west front were rebuilt in the 17th century, after

secularized.</p>

<p>The nave, separated from the rest of the building by a wall, was
used before the war as a hall for public meetings, while a geological
museum was to have been installed in the transept and choir.</p>

<p>The façade is 17th century.</p>

on the roof of the nave, breaking it in many places.</p>

<p>The nave, with double side-aisles, was reconstructed in the 17th
century, and is of little interest. Three of its vaulted bays have fallen
in (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p>The two-armed transept, as well as the choir which terminates in a
canted chevet (<i>photos opposite and below</i>) were less injured.
They date from the 13th century, but have been restored. They have
pointed vaults, and are lighted by high and low windows separated by a
narrow triforium. The windows of the transept-ends and of the choir are
double and surmounted by a rose-window; those of the apse are single
and framed outside by abutments. The wall at the end of the north arm
of the transept, at the back of which were the monastic buildings, has
no opening, but that of the south arm is entirely open. The exterior
façades of both arms end in a gable pierced by narrow slits and are
flanked by buttresses in the form of polygonal turrets. The east
buttress of the north arm was badly damaged by a shell.</p>

<p>Shell holes are visible in the walls of the chevet and in the vaulting
of the south arm of the transept.</p>

<p>The Hôtel-de-Ville occupies the old Hôtel de l’Intendance, built

<p>Its Museum and Library did not escape damage and were, moreover
pillaged, while some of the pictures in the museum were lacerated.
However, many objects were removed in time to be saved.</p>

<p>The <b>museum</b> contains some fine sculpture, including: the tympanum
of a 13th century portal taken from the Church of Saint-Yved-de-Braisne,
representing <i>The Descent of Christ into Hades</i>; another
defaced 14th century tympanum from the cloister of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes;
a Romanesque storied capital: <i>Abraham sacrificing Isaac</i>

of them (n<sup>o</sup> 5 in the court) has a curious doorway with a carved 14th
century tympanum.</p>

<p>A carved panel over the doorway represents the King of Spain
bidding farewell to the King of France. This doorway leads to a
tower of the same period (restored), the upper part of which was
struck by a shell.</p>

<p>At n<sup>o</sup> 11, in the Rue de Bauton is the <i>Palais-de-Justice</i>, partly destroyed

<h3 class="nobreak"><b>ABBEY OF SAINT-JEAN-DES-VIGNES</b>
(<i>Hist. Mon.</i>)</h3>
</div>

<p>Founded in 1076, the Abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes was one of
the richest and most powerful monasteries of the Middle-Ages.</p>

<p>The liberality of the Kings of France, bishops, nobility and middle
classes enabled the monks in the 13th and 14th centuries to erect a
large abbey-church and important monastic buildings, the plan of
which has been preserved in an engraving of 1673, <i>reproduced below</i>.</p>

<p>The plan is that followed almost invariably for monastic buildings.
In the middle is the abbey-church. The monastery buildings proper:
the rooms of the Regulars to which strangers are not admitted,
the Novices’ quarters, the dormitories and refectory, are grouped
round the four galleries of the cloister, which extend from the south
front of the church.</p>

<p>On the east side of the cloister is a smaller cloister, abutting on
which are the strangers’ rooms: the refectory and dormitories.</p>

<p>Behind, stands the isolated hospital with its own chapel. Near the
entrance is the Abbot’s house, and further to the east, the store-rooms.</p>

<p>The entrance was fortified, and a continuous wall with roadway,
loop-holes and watch-towers, completely encircled the Abbey.</p>

<p>Beyond this wall stretched the vineyards and agricultural estates
of the monastery. Although despoiled during the Hundred Years
War, and later during the religious wars, the Abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes
remained rich and flourishing until the Revolution when
the monks were expelled. Some years later (1805), an imperial decree
issued at the request of the Bishop of Soissons, ordered the demolition
of the church, the materials of which were to be used for
repairing the cathedral. The protests of the inhabitants induced
the Bishop to have the main front preserved.</p>

<p>Three late 13th century portals surmounted by gables open in the
façade. Under the central portal are two <b>mutilated statues</b>: <i>on the
right</i>, Saint-Augustin; <i>on the left</i>: Saint-John-the-Baptist clothed
in the skin of an animal.</p>

<p>A graceful clerestory gallery, continued at the back round a wide
platform, which at one time formed a gallery above the grand nave,
separates the central portal from the large rose-window set in an irregular
arch. The latter has lost its interior net-work of mullions and is
surmounted by a gable. The gallery and rose-window are late 14th
century.</p>

</div>
</div>
<br>

<p>A two-storied tower crowned by a spire rises above each of the side
portals. The first story dates from the end of the 14th century. The
upper part, which differs in each tower, is more than a century later.</p>

<p>The south tower (<i>on the right of the photo below</i>), was about 230 feet
in height.</p>

<p>The north tower, finished in 1520, was higher (about 244 feet) and
more massive.</p>

<p>On the first story in the niche next the large rose-window, a statue
of the Virgin faces a statue of the Angel of the Annunciation, which
stands on the opposite buttress of the south tower.</p>

<p>Both stories of the north tower, separated by a Flamboyant gallery
with very sharply pointed gables, are pierced with large bays divided
by a mullion.</p>

<p>On the west side, against the mullion of the upper bay, is a figure
of Christ crucified.</p>

<p>The octagonal spire, surrounded 
by four turrets, is pierced on each face by
three openings of different sizes, the largest being under-most, while
its angles are adorned with projecting crockets.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">The façade of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes after the bombardments.</h4>

<p>Previously, in 1870, the façade of the church had been badly damaged.
The German shells set fire to a store of hay housed under the
porches, the splays of which were destroyed (<i>p. </i><a href="#Page_46">46</a>).</p>

<p>In 1914, it suffered fresh injury, both spires being struck by shells.
The south tower lost its upper part, the remaining portion being torn
open at the base. The other tower was badly indented near its point,
while the carvings of the buttresses were injured. The whole façade
was moreover pitted by shell-splinters.</p>

<p>The damage caused in 1918 was considerably greater. In some
places the stone-work of the portals and towers was entirely destroyed,
and in others indented more or less deeply. The fine and delicate
carvings of the towers were also smashed. The north tower suffered
most. A breach, jeopardizing its stability, was made almost the
whole way up, and the upper part of the spire fell to the ground, like
the other spire had done four years before. The interior vaulting which
connected the two towers, partially fell in.</p>

<p>At the back of the façade (<i>photo above</i>) which was also struck in
several places, there are still traces of the first bay of the old nave
of the abbey-church, pulled down under the Empire.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak">The Great Cloister of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes.</h4>

<p>Under the south portal stands a 13th century doorway, with vaulting
and tympanums decorated with finely carved foliage, which
led from the abbey-church to the great cloister.</p>

<p>Of the great 14th century cloister, only the south and west galleries
remain. Each has seven bays with pointed arches resting, on one
side, on brackets ornamented with foliage or human figures, and on the
other, on piers surrounded by small columns (<i>photos above and below</i>).</p>
<p>The large arches in tierce-point, ornamented with fine mouldings
and separated by highly-wrought buttresses, formed an inner arcade
composed of two bays surmounted by a rose-window. Traces of it
are left in three bays of the south gallery (<i>photo below</i>). The arches
formerly contained windows.</p>

<p>The cloister, especially the south end, was often struck by German

</div>
<br>

<p>The refectory, over 130 feet in length, contains two naves with
pointed vaulting. The pointed arches rest on fine columns with foliate
capitals, which are buttressed outside by piers engaged in the
stone-work. Like all monastery refectories, it has a raised and vaulted
platform, from which one of the monks read aloud during meals.</p>

<p>The refectory, used as a store-house, is divided into two stories by
a floor which runs below the capitals of the columns.</p>

<p>Outside the refectory, on the side next the cloister, were six large
rose-windows, since transformed into small rectangular windows, and
on the west front, eight tierce-point windows, now blocked up.</p>

<p>At the base of the loft-roof, set at intervals, are dormer-windows,
whereof one Renaissance.</p>

<p>The roof, damaged in places, was completely destroyed by the
bombardments over several of the bays. A large breach, already
repaired, was made in the end bay on the east side. One buttress
was destroyed and the adjacent part of the framework of one of the
rose-windows broken (<i>photo above</i>).</p>

<p>The great cloister communicated on the east with a small cloister,
rebuilt about 1550 in Renaissance style, of which several bays of the
south gallery remain standing.</p>

<p>Lastly, on this side of the façade of the church, to the east, is a
building, re-erected in the 16th century for the Abbot’s residence,
but which has been completely disfigured by its adaptation for military
purposes. It is flanked by an octagonal turret containing a staircase.</p>

<p>Many shells fell on the Grand Séminaire, causing serious damage.
A great part of the roofing was destroyed and in places large openings
were torn in the walls.</p>

<p>At the north-west end of the park of the Grand Séminaire, excavations
made in the 19th century, now filled in, uncovered the remains
of a Roman amphitheatre. These remains indicated a theatre of
very large dimensions, measuring about 470 feet across its greatest

<p>Numerous defensive works surrounded this chateau and the farm
belonging to it. These buildings, now entirely in ruins, occupied the

<p><i>After visiting Saint-Crépin, take the road</i> (<i>V.O.</i> 15),<i> along which ran
strong defence-works and which leads to the Promenade du Mail. Follow
the promenade towards the town as far as Pont-Neuf.</i></p>

<p>The Promenade du Mail, extending from the Hôtel-de-Ville to Vauxrot,
contained a trench throughout its entire length which led to
the front lines in the northern sector.</p>

<p>The Mail, bordered by the river Aisne and planted with century-old
trees, dates from the 17th and 18th centuries, and before the
War was one of the finest public gardens in France.</p>

<p>It was completely spoilt by formidable defence-works. A series
of trenches, strengthened by defence-works of every kind and by strong
points such as the Brasserie du Mail on the Bank of the Aisne, began
in the middle of the Mail. They branched out at the end of the Promenade
into a great number of outposts, blockhouses and observation
posts, from which the naked eye could discern the entrenchments
of the camouflaged German outposts on the right bank of the Aisne.</p>

<p>Communication with the Allies’ bridge-head on both banks was
ensured by foot-bridges, constantly under fire, and temporary ways
over the two partially destroyed bridges.</p>

<p>The Pont-Neuf or Pont-du-Mail, over which passes the National
Road (N<sup>o</sup> 2) from Paris to Maubeuge, was built in 1903 of reinforced
concrete.</p>

<p>On September 1, 1914, the British blew up the middle arch. It
was subsequently found possible to contrive a crossing over the broken
arch, hidden from the view of the enemy by the gaily coloured
tents of a travelling show which happened to be in Soissons when war
was declared (<i>photo below</i>).</p>

<p>On the north of the distillery, beyond “No man’s land” with its
barbed-wire entanglements, a very important <b>glass-works</b> formed the
first German line. Before the war, these glass-works turned out several
millions of champagne bottles every year. <i>A heap of these

<p>Between the buildings of these works, now completely ruined by
the incessant bombardments, are countless passages and trenches
of reinforced concrete, observation posts, blockhouses, concrete machine-gun

<p>After crossing this road, about half-way between Soissons and Crouy,
they encircle the <b>hamlet of St-Paul</b> on the north and east. This
fortified hamlet formed the <b>Saint-Paul salient</b> and protected the
faubourg of Saint-Waast.</p>

<br>

<p>From Saint-Paul the trenches, sloping towards the south, extended
in front of the strongly fortified Faubourg of Saint-Médard and rejoined
the Aisne at the point where the river forms a great loop above
Soissons. It was the eastern sector of the defences, covering alike
the Faubourg of Saint-Waast and the bridge-head on the right bank.</p>

<p><i>To go from Saint-Paul to Saint-Médard, return to the Place de Laon.

<p>The Faubourg of Saint-Médard is as old as the town itself. In fact,
it existed in the Roman era, and later became one of the favorite residences
of the Merovingian Kings, who owned a large “villa” there.</p>

<br>

<p>About 556, Clotaire I had the greatly revered Bishop of Noyon,
Saint-Médard, buried in this villa, and erected over his grave a basilica,
round which a monastery was built.</p>

<p>After playing an important part in the history of the early Middle-Ages,
this monastery attracted 300 000 pilgrims as late as 1530.
The buildings were devastated during the many sieges to which Soissons
was subjected. Rebuilt in the 17th, they were converted in
the 19th century into a school for deaf-mutes and the blind.</p>

<p>Of the ancient buildings, there remains only a <b>crypt</b>, one of the
oldest in France and of great archæological interest.</p>

<p>Built in the 9th century and measuring about 80 feet in length,
8 feet in width and 13 feet in height, this crypt (<i>photo below</i>) includes
a central gallery with groined vault, off which open chapels.</p>

<p>The vaulting rests on very thick walls, in which small niches have
been hollowed out as seats for the pilgrims.</p>

<i>Defence-Works in the Rue des Graviers, near the Church</i> (<i>see Itinerary</i>).</div>
</div>
<br>

<p>The church of Saint-Waast, built in the 19th century, consists of
a large central pile with aisles on each side of the nave. A graceful
belfry, ending in a spire, rises over the portal. The interior of the
building is not vaulted, but has a timber-work roof. The arches are
supported by square pillars and the walls ornamented with pictures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>The bombardments did great damage. Everywhere the roof was
broken in and a large part completely destroyed. In the walls are
numerous gaps, while the façade is pitted by shell-splinters. The
belfry, very badly damaged on the first story, had two of its sides in
the upper story completely demolished. The spire fell down in 1918.
The interior of the main building suffered less, but the timber-work
roof was badly damaged.</p>

<p>The Faubourg Saint-Waast led to the first lines of the north-east
sector of Soissons, which passed north of the hamlet of Saint-Paul.</p>

<p>Because of its situation, it had been put in a complete state of defence
and was continually bombarded. The railway station, gas-works
and most of the factories were destroyed. In places, it is nothing
more than a heap of ruins with, here and there, vestiges of the old military
works.</p>

<p><i>Return to the Rue du Champ-Bouillant, follow same as far as the Aisne,
crossing the latter at the Pont Saint-Waast.</i></p>

</div>
</div>
<br>

<p>The pont Saint-Waast, also called the Pont des Anglais (since the
war) dates from the Middle-Ages (<i>photo above</i>). Of the original
structure there remain the arches on the Saint-Waast side (restored).
The rest of the bridge consists of an iron platform which the Germans
destroyed on September 13, 1914, when they evacuated the
town.</p>

<p>Rebuilt by the British in 1914, together with a foot-bridge,
it ensured communication between the centre of the town and
the Faubourg Saint-Waast, in spite of incessant bombardments.</p>

<hr class="r15">

<p>The ‘Office National du Tourisme’ was created by
Act of Parliament on April 8th 1910, and reorganized
in 1917. It enjoys civil privileges and financial autonomy.</p>

<p>It is directed by an Administrative Council chosen
by the Minister of Public Works.</p>

<p>Its mission is to seek out every means of developing
travel; to urge, and if necessary to take any measure
capable of ameliorating the conditions of the transport,
circulation and sojourn of tourists.</p>

<p>It co-ordinates the efforts of touring societies and
industries, encourages them in the execution of their programmes
and stimulates legislative and administrative initiative
with regard to the development of travel in France.</p>

<p>It promotes understanding between the Public Services,
the great Transport Companies, the ‘Syndicats d’Initiative’
and the ‘Syndicats Professionnels’.</p>

<p>It organises propaganda in foreign countries; and tends
towards the creation of Travel Inquiry Offices in France
and abroad, with a view to making known the scenery and
monuments of France, as well as the health-giving powers
of French mineral waters, spas and bathing places.</p>

<p class="center">WHAT IS IT? WHAT ARE ITS USES?</p>
<br>

<p>The ‘Touring-Club de France’ (founded in 1890), is
at the present time the largest Touring Association in the
whole world. Its principal aim is to introduce France—admirable
country and one of the loveliest on earth—to
French people themselves and to foreigners.</p>

<p>It seeks to develop travel in all its forms: on foot, on
horseback, on bicycle, in carriage, motor, yacht or railway,
and soon in aeroplane.</p>

<p>Every member of the Association receives a badge and
an identity ticket free of charge, as also the ‘Revue Mensuelle’
every month.</p>

<p>Members have also the benefit of special prices in a
certain number of affiliated hotels; and this holds good
for the purchase of guide-books and Staff (Etat-major)
maps, as well as those of the ‘Ministère de l’Intérieur’, the
T. C. F., etc. They may insert notices regarding the
sale or purchase of travelling requisites, in the ‘Revue’
(1 fr. per line). The ‘Comité des Contentieux’ is ready
to give them counsel with regard to travelling, and
3.000 delegates in all the principal towns are able to give
them advice and information about the curiosities of art
or of nature in the neighbourhood, as well as concerning
the roads, hotels, motor-agents, garages, etc.</p>

<p>Members are accorded free passage across the frontier
for a bicycle or motor-bicycle. For a motor-car the
Association gives a ‘Triptyque’ ensuring free passage
through the ‘douane’, etc.</p>
